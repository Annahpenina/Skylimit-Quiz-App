Updated saved memory
Here's a step-by-step plan to build a quiz app that generates questions from an uploaded PDF, all within 1 week, with zero cost:

üß† Overview
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js + Express (Free on Render or Railway)

PDF Parsing & Quiz Generation: Use OpenAI API (free tier) or open-source NLP tools (zero-cost route)

Storage (Optional): Firebase Free Tier / Local JSON / IndexedDB

‚úÖ Daily Breakdown Plan (1 Week)
Day 1: Plan & Set Up
Outline features:

Upload PDF

Extract text

Generate quiz (MCQs or short answers)

Display quiz

Time limit feature

Set up project folders:

/frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)

/backend (Node.js + Express)

Choose a free hosting platform (Render, Railway, Vercel)

Day 2: Frontend UI
Build upload form (PDF)

Add timer input (e.g. "Enter time in minutes")

Add quiz container section (placeholder for now)

Use vanilla JS or any lightweight framework (e.g. Alpine.js)

Example (HTML):

html
Copy
Edit
<input type="file" id="pdf-upload" accept="application/pdf">
<input type="number" id="timer" placeholder="Enter time (minutes)">
<button onclick="uploadPdf()">Upload</button>
<div id="quiz-container"></div>
Day 3: Backend - PDF Parsing
Set up Express server

Install pdf-parse to extract text from PDF:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install express multer pdf-parse
Route: POST /upload ‚Üí Accepts PDF ‚Üí Extracts text

js
Copy
Edit
const pdf = require('pdf-parse');
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  const dataBuffer = fs.readFileSync(req.file.path);
  const data = await pdf(dataBuffer);
  res.json({ text: data.text });



what to include  on building the quiz app


ChatGPT said:
Here‚Äôs a checklist of what to include when building the quiz app ‚Äî both in terms of features and components ‚Äî to make it fully functional and user-friendly, while sticking to your goal (PDF ‚Üí Quiz, zero cost, 1 week):
