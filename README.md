# Skylimit-Quiz-App

**About**
The Skylimit Quiz App, lets the user to upload a pdf of their choice and the app will scan the pdf file and generate quizes to help the user to study, practice what they have learn, the app will be a ble to scan text, tables, charts, numbers as well, and be able to make sumarries of the scanned pdf files at the end of the quiz. The app will save user credentials and pdf files uploaded and quize questions and the user can access the content of the app any where, with a posibility to have a downloadeable app.

**Design and Ideas**
16. Quiz App
A Quiz App presents multiple-choice questions and tracks user answers. It provides instant feedback and calculates scores. You’ll build a question bank and may add timers. This project helps with dynamic scoring logic and smooth transitions.

What Will You Learn?

Question Bank Setup: You’ll design arrays or databases to store questions.
Dynamic Scoring: You’ll calculate results instantly based on chosen answers.
Timer Handling: You’ll include a countdown for each question to add urgency.
Basic Feedback Mechanisms: You’ll show whether an answer was correct or not.

Updated saved memory
Here's a step-by-step plan to build a quiz app that generates questions from an uploaded PDF, all within 1 week, with zero cost:

🧠 Overview
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js + Express (Free on Render or Railway)

PDF Parsing & Quiz Generation: Use OpenAI API (free tier) or open-source NLP tools (zero-cost route)

Storage (Optional): Firebase Free Tier / Local JSON / IndexedDB

✅ Daily Breakdown Plan (1 Week)
Day 1: Plan & Set Up
Outline features:

Upload PDF

Extract text

Generate quiz (MCQs or short answers)

Display quiz

Time limit feature

Set up project folders:

/frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)

/backend (Node.js + Express)

Choose a free hosting platform (Render, Railway, Vercel)

Day 2: Frontend UI
Build upload form (PDF)

Add timer input (e.g. "Enter time in minutes")

Add quiz container section (placeholder for now)

Use vanilla JS or any lightweight framework (e.g. Alpine.js)

Example (HTML):

html
Copy
Edit
<input type="file" id="pdf-upload" accept="application/pdf">
<input type="number" id="timer" placeholder="Enter time (minutes)">
<button onclick="uploadPdf()">Upload</button>
<div id="quiz-container"></div>
Day 3: Backend - PDF Parsing
Set up Express server

Install pdf-parse to extract text from PDF:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install express multer pdf-parse
Route: POST /upload → Accepts PDF → Extracts text

js
Copy
Edit
const pdf = require('pdf-parse');
const multer = require('multer');
const upload = multer({ dest: 'uploads/' });

app.post('/upload', upload.single('file'), async (req, res) => {
  const dataBuffer = fs.readFileSync(req.file.path);
  const data = await pdf(dataBuffer);
  res.json({ text: data.text });



what to include  on building the quiz app


ChatGPT said:
Here’s a checklist of what to include when building the quiz app — both in terms of features and components — to make it fully functional and user-friendly, while sticking to your goal (PDF → Quiz, zero cost, 1 week):

✅ Core Features to Include
1. PDF Upload
File input (accept .pdf)

PDF sent to backend for processing

2. PDF Text Extraction
Use pdf-parse on the backend to extract readable text

Clean the text (remove headers/footers, repeated sections if needed)

3. Quiz Generation
Generate quiz questions based on PDF content

Types of questions:

Multiple Choice (MCQ)

True/False

Fill in the blank (optional)

Options:

Use AI (like OpenAI free credits) OR

Use local logic with natural, compromise, or simple regex

4. Quiz Display UI
Show each question with options

Allow users to select an answer

Include “Next” and “Previous” buttons or all questions at once

5. Timer
User sets quiz time before starting

Countdown starts when quiz begins

Auto-submit when time runs out

6. Submit & Score
Evaluate answers on submit

Display results: score, correct/incorrect answers

Option to retry or review

7. Basic Validation
Only accept .pdf file types

Ensure quiz can’t be submitted twice

Handle empty or invalid PDFs

js
Copy
Edit
// Prompt: "Generate 5 quiz questions from the following content:\n${text}"
Send response back to frontend in this format:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  { question: "What is ...?", options: ["A", "B", "C", "D"], answer: "A" },
  ...
]
Day 5: Show Quiz + Timer
Render quiz questions on frontend

Allow selection (radio buttons)

Add countdown timer (JS setInterval)

Disable quiz once timer hits 0

Add "Submit" button
